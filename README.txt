Creating the database: 
On your VM shell, from within the directory containing the milestone1.sql file, run the command: 

dropdb tutors; createdb tutors; psql tutors -af milestone1.sql

This should create and populate the database with sample data (for now) for use in querying.

If you would now like to open the SQL interpreter, run the command: psql tutors.


Data generation:
Our “production” dataset will eventually be generated by teacher requests. Teachers are able to request tutors through a Qualtrics survey. The data from this survey (all requests) will be able to be uploaded to our web application via a csv file. As such, we currently do not have an entire “production” dataset. We have included a file (TutorRequestTest.csv) that shows the format in which the data will be uploaded.
