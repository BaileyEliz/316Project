We decided on using PHP and HTML. We are using a LAMP stack.

Our decision to use PHP stemmed from the fact that nobody in our group was familiar with PHP at the start of the project.
We wanted to take this opportunity to learn a new language and improve our skills. 

The example code given from course instructors was extremely helpful in setting up our initial web application.
While our existing web application is quite simple, we have everything functioning correctly.

Professor Yang also suggested that we use PHP based on the nature of our project.
