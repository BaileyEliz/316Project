<h1>Request Success!</h1>

<!-- can implement later to use history.go when request fails due to some constraint violation or use index.php if the request succeeds -->
<!-- or will likely use form vaildation to ensure it doesn't fail, but on the off chance it does, the go back link can still be present -->
